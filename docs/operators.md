a.b         member access
a[b]        get function
!a          logical not?
~a          bitwise not
+a          unary plus? This is a no-op
-a          unary negation
a ** b      exponentiation
a * b       multiplication
a / b       division
a % b       remainder
a + b       addition
a - b       subtraction
a << b      left shift
a >> b      right shift
a < b       less than
a > b       greater than
a <= b      less than or equal
a >= b      greater than or equal
a == b      equal
a != b      not equal
a & b       and
a | b       or
a ^ b       xor

we don't need logical && or logical ||
because there is no short circuit in a pure functional language
