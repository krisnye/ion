remove is and isnt and replace with === and !== explicit operators.
    because of possible confusion with ES7+ is/isnt operator proposals.
    also remove not, and, or operators and replace with !, &&, || for consistency.

need a base class object1

need merging syntactic sugar

a.b.c: 1
=>
a:
    b:
        c: 1

Need to fix array comprehensions to be lazily evaluated:
    let _ref = [];
    {
        let _ref2 = this.body;
        for (let _i = 0; _i < _ref2.length; _i++) {
            let s = _ref2[_i];
            _ref.push(this.context.createRuntime(s));
        }
    }
    this.statements = this.statements != null ? this.statements : _ref;

Optimize this: => if (!(this.statements != null))

This should be an error:
    console.log(x)
    let x = 12

need to merge properties on output object so this works:
    style:
        color: 'red'

why does ["manifest.json"]: work, but not "manifest.json":?

X   import(foo).bar is currently compiled to require((foo).bar), should be require(foo).bar

X   assert should work with multiline expressions.

X   []
        should, allow, adding
        several, things, per line

    replace ion.mergePatch with extra properties accessible but undocumented on ion.patch

    investigate a const declaration in a loop not working within a for loop on rhino, may need Rhino unit tests.

    This:
        let keyHandler = (@handlers ?= {})[key] ?= {value:undefined,handlers:[]}
    Expands to this bullshit:
        let keyHandler = (this.handlers = this.handlers != null ? this.handlers : {})[key] = (this.handlers = this.handlers != null ? this.handlers : {})[key] != null ? (this.handlers = this.handlers != null ? this.handlers : {})[key] : {
            value: void 0,
            handlers: []
        };

    Make this work, it doesn't right now, and improve existential operator generated code.
    object?.connected = presence.isConnected
