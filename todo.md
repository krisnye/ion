x   Next, I'm going to deal with exports file.
x   Separate files and support for incremental compilation and tree shaking.
x   Create Scope map function.
    Class Inheritance.
    Optional function parameters locations placed in correct location.
    Then it's on to the type system. (just the runtime type system).
    Then probably going to add actual real functions and calls.
    Then code generation to Javascript (with proper abstraction so it can target anything)
    Then we should have a working (but pure and without external function interface yet) language.
