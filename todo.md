Next, I'm going to deal with exports and then move things into a global assembly scope as if it's just a single file.
Then it's on to the type system.
Then probably going to add actual real functions and calls.
Then code generation to Javascript (with proper abstraction so it can target anything)
Then we should have a working (but pure and without external function interface yet) language
